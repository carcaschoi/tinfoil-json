# Introduction & Features

#### *WARNING, Luffshop IS NOT A TINFOIL SHOP. It is a FORWADER instead. It does NOT host games. Luffshop redirects to other available tinfoil shops automatically, so you don't need to add each shop manually and automatically updates links if the shop are added/updated. The author of Luffshop is NOT responsible for anythings found on TINFOIL by adding this Forwarder.

* You are recommended to DELETE the current Tinfoil locations.conf [switch/tinfoil/locations.conf] from your SD card before adding server.

## FAQs

Q: I can search XXX in the menu but downloads failed (///commonly asked///)

> A: You have to set up Oauth if you cannot download  XXX  from tinfoil -> Guide: https://bit.ly/38HEr48

Q: I have already added Luffshop, but why no shop is loaded?

> A: This usually occurs when the time of your switch does not the same as the real-time. Please use [switch-time](https://github.com/3096/switch-time) to adjust the time of your switch. Or The shops you are trying to access could be down currently.


Q: I can't open tinfoil... :(

> A: Make sure that you install the latest [Sigpatches](https://github.com/ITotalJustice/patches/releases/latest) in your switch. Then try to reinstall tinfoil.


Q: network error 7 occurs?

> A: Maybe it is a poor network connection. If you are using a LAN cable, you can try to reinsert it.
