### Ultimate server by carcaschoi
一 One of the parts of [ShallowSea AIO Package](https://github.com/carcaschoi/ShallowSea) Project
### Introduction & Features
** just to clarify, IT IS NOT A TINFOIL SHOP WHICH CONTAINS GAMES COPY. 
* Ultimate server redirects to other alternative shops automatically, so you don't need to add shop manually if the shop links are updated.
* User friendly？？

# How to use
Firstly, you must jailbreak your own nintendo switch with Custom firmware. The CFW I recommended is Atmosphere-NX with sigpatches

You are recommend to delete file [switch/tinfoil/locations.conf] before adding server

Then adding this Ulimate server in [tinfoil](https://tinfoil.io). It will auto add and update all of the alternative shops.

NOTES: You have to be patient after adding ultimate server. It will take around 3-5 minutes to load the server.
