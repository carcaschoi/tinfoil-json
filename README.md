# Requirements

* Nintendo Switch running CFW ([Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/releases) with [Sigpatches](https://github.com/ITotalJustice/patches/releases) recommended).

* Relies on [Tinfoil](https://tinfoil.io).

* You are recommended to DELETE the current Tinfoil locations.conf [switch/tinfoil/locations.conf] from your SD card before adding server.

* To avoid getting banned make sure you have already setup [Exosphere / DNS MITM](https://rentry.org/ExosphereDNSMITM).

#### You have to set up OAuth if you cannot download  「something」  from Tinfoil.
* Follow the Guide to set up: https://bit.ly/38HEr48.

## FAQ

Q: Why aren't the shops loaded?

> A: This usually occurs when the time of your Switch does not the same as the real-time. Please use [switch-time](https://github.com/3096/switch-time) to adjust the time of your Switch. Another circumstance might be that the shops you are trying to access could be down currently.


Q: I can't open tinfoil... :(

> A: Make sure that you install the latest [Sigpatches](https://github.com/ITotalJustice/patches/releases/latest) in your switch and are booting with fusee.bin instead of Hekate. Then try to reinstall tinfoil.


Q: Network Error 7 occurs when I try to download.

> A: It is most commonly a poor network connection. If you are using a LAN cable, try reinserting it.
